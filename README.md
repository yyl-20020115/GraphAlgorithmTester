NP=P as proven by traveller problem

Just simply follow the graph parallelly and split the path when there is a branch point(node).
After all possible paths are collected, measure the total length of the edges.

Finally, sort by distance and then you get the solutions of the traveller problem.

It can be treated as a proof for "NP=P".

READ THE CODE FOR DETAILS! (C#)
